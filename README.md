This repository provides an implementation of the ideation about self-harm and suicide prediction model (ISSPM) introduced in paper "Network-based prediction of the disclosure of ideation about self-harm and suicide in online counseling sessions".

ISSPM is a novel network-based prediction model harnessing the strength of complex network theory. It predicts the expression of self-harm and suicide ideation in an online text-based counseling platform. With such assistance, counselors can prepare in advance to pay attention to the impending utterance of ideation about self-harm and suicide.

The general architecture of ISSPM is showed in the following.
